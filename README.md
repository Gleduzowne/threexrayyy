# 🎉 ThreeXRAYYY 🎉

Welcome to **ThreeXRAYYY**! This is a general-purpose 2D/3D animation engine designed to make creating animations for mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, and other scientific concepts a breeze. Think of it as a blend of Blender and specialized scientific tools! 🌟

## 🚀 Features

- **2D and 3D Rendering**: Render stunning 2D sprites and 3D meshes with ease.
- **Animation Utilities**: Smooth animations with built-in easing functions and custom animation controllers.
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Add new features and tools through a robust plugin system.
- **Scientific Simulations**: Special tooling for creating animations and simulations in various scientific fields.

## 🛠️ Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use ThreeXRAYYY to render a 3D mesh:

```dart
import 'package:threexrayyy/models/3d/mesh.dart';
import 'package:threexrayyy/models/3d/texture.dart';
import 'package:threexrayyy/core/rendering/renderer.dart';

void main() {
  Texture texture = Texture('path/to/texture.png');
  Mesh mesh = Mesh([/* vertices */], [/* indices */], texture);
  Renderer renderer = Renderer();

  renderer.render3D(mesh);
}
```
